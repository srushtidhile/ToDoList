# To-Do List README

This is a list maker web application programmed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript based on Node.JS along with a MongoDB Atlas hosted database to store the list items. The web app has features that allow the user to add unlimited items and check them off. Users can create custom lists other than "Today" lists by adding "/customName" to the home route URL.
